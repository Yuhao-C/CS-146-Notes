# C Expressions

* infix operations `1 + 2`
* function calls `f(a, b, c)`
* Operator prececence - follow mathematical conventions
* `printf("%d\n", 5)`
  * `5` substituted for `%d`
  * `%d` displays a base-10 integer value
  * produces the number of characters printed

***

## Statements

* `printf("%d\n", 5);` - (semicolon makes an expr a statement)
* `5+4;` - computes 5+4, does nothing with result
value of expr is ignored
* expressions are evaluated only for their side effects
* `return 0;` - produce the value 0 as the result of the function, return control immediately to the caller
* `;` - empty statement (do nothing)
  
### Blocks - Groups of Statements

```C
{
  stmt1;
  stmt2;
  ...
  stmtn;
}
```

### Functions

```C
int f(int x, int y) {
  printf("x = %d, y = %d\n", x, y);
  return x + y;
}
```

#### Function calls

* `f(3, 4)` - expression - evaluates to 7
* `f(3, 4);` - statement - expr is evaluated but answer is never used

> *A programs is a sequence of functions, starting with main()*

#### Function Declaration

* C enforces declaration before use - can't use a fn/variable/etc. until you tell C about it.
* One Solution: put f first. Works, but overkill, not necessary
* C only requires declaration (statement of existence) before use. So, we can simply write before main int f(int, int); // fn prototype or fn header

## Header

```C
#include<stdlib.h>
```

* `#include` is not part of the C language
* It directs to the C preprocessor (which runs before compilation)
* It is like macro expansion in Racket
* `#include<file.h>` copys the contents of `file.h` to the program
* `stdio.h` contains declarations for `printf` and other I/O functions
* A *linker* takes care of linking function declarations from header files to their definitions automatically
  * if you write your own module, you need to tell the linker about it

***

## Types

Everything in our memory (where these value are stored) are just numbers. Characters are restricted form of integers.

* `int` - varies but typically 32 bits
* `char` - 8 bits (256 distinct values)
* `'0'` - the character 0, numerically 48 according to ASCII
* `'9'` - the character 9, numerically 57 according to ASCII
