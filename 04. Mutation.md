# Mutation

## Mutation in Racket

```scheme
(define x 3)
(set! x 4)
x
=> 4
```

### Example

```scheme
(lookup 'Rob)
=> false
(add 'Rob 3)
(lookup 'Rob)
=> 3
```

### Implementation in impure Racket

```scheme
(define address-book empty) ;; global variable
(define (add name number)
(set! address-book
  (cons (list name number) address-book))
```

**Global data**: good for defining constants going to be used repeatedly.

* But not great with mutations
* Any part of the program could change global
* Affects the entire program
* Hidden dependencies between different parts of the program
* Harder to reason about programs

### Application

* **Caching**: Saving the result of computation to avoid repeating
* **Memoization**: maintaining a list or table of cached values

#### Consider

```scheme
(define (fib n)
  (cond
    [(= n 0) 0]
    [(= n 1) 1]
    [else (+ (fib (- n 1))
             (fib (- n 2)))]))
```

It is inefficient becasue recursive calls are repeated doing the same computation:

* `(fib 98)` called twice, `(fib 97)` called three times
* `(fib n)` is $\theta$`(f n)`
* To avoid repetition, we can keep an associated list of already computed value

```scheme
(define fib-table empty)

(define (memo-fib n)
  (define result (assoc n fib-table))
  (cond
    [result => second]
    ;; [cond => f] -> if cond is true, then evaluate (f cond)
    [else
     (define fib-n
       (cond
         [(<= n 1) n]
         [else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
                  (memo-fib (- n 2)))]))
     (set! fib-table (cons (list n fib-n) fib-table))
     fib-n]))
```

* Now fib-table is a global variable. Can we hide it?

```scheme
(define memo-fib2
  (local
    [(define fib-table empty)
     (define (memo-fib n)
       (define result (assoc n fib-table))
       (cond
         [result => second]
         [else
          (define fib-n
            (cond
              [(<= n 1) n]
              [else (+ (memo-fib (- n 1))
                       (memo-fib (- n 2)))]))
          (set! fib-table (cons (list n fib-n) fib-table))
          fib-n]))]
    (Î» (n) (memo-fib n))))
```

* We can also keep the computed value in the accumulator

```scheme
(define (accum-fib-helper n acc)
  (define result (assoc n acc))
  (cond
    [result acc]
    [else
     (define next-acc (accum-fib-helper (- n 1) (accum-fib-helper (- n 2) acc)))
     (cons (list n (+ (second (assoc (- n 1) next-acc))
                      (second (assoc (- n 2) next-acc))))
           next-acc)]))

(define (accum-fib n)
  (second (assoc n (accum-fib-helper n (list (list 0 0) (list 1 1))))))
```

## Mutation in C

### Assignment

* assignment operator: `=`

```C
// mutate x to have the value 5
// equivalent to (set! x 5) in racket
x = 5
```

* `x = 4` sets x to 4, produces 4

```C
int main() {
  int x = 3;
  printf("%d\n", x); // print 3
  printf("%d\n", x = 4); // print 4
}
```

* advantage

```C
x = y = z = 7; // sets x, y, z to 7
```

* disadvantage that often leads to errors

```C
int main() {
  int x = 5;
  if (x = 4) { // error: should use "==" instead of "="
    printf("%d\n", x); // print 4
  }
}
```

* can leave variables uninitialized and assign later

```C
int main() {
  int x; // uninitialized
  x = 4; // assignment
}
```

```C
int x;
if (x == 0) { // Will this run or not?
              // don't know. x's value undefined
}
// Typically its value will be whatever was in the memory before it
```

***

### Global Variables

```C
int c = 0;

int f() {
  int d = c;
  c = c + 1;
  return d;
}

int main() {
  printf("%d\n", f()); // print 0
  printf("%d\n", f()); // print 1
  printf("%d\n", f()); // print 2
}
```

> ***Careful***:
> `printf("%d\n %d\n %d\n", f(), f(), f());`
>
> could produce: `0 1 2` or `2 1 0` or `1 0 2` ......

Can we hide c within f, as we did in fib-table?

```C
int f() {
  static int c = 0; // c is a global variable
  int d = c;
  c = c + 1;
  return d;
}
```

Global constants can still be helpful! We can force a variable to be constant in C

```C
const int passingGrade = 50;
```

***

### Repetition

#### recursion

```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n) {
  if (n > 0) {
    printf("hi!\n");
    sayHiNTimes(n-1);
  }
}
```

***

#### while loop

```C
void sayHiNTimes(int n) {
  while (n > 0) {
    printf("hi!\n");
    n = n = 1;
  }
}
```

>a loop - the body of a loop is a group executed repeatedly so long as the condtion remains true.

*Loops and recursions are mathematically equivalent.*

***

#### Common Pattern

```C
(initialize vars)
while (condition) {
  (body)
  (update)
}
```

or

```C
for (init; condition; update) {
  (body)
}
```

***

#### Updating Counters

* short hands

```C
c += 1; // c = c + 1;
c -= 2; // c = c - 2;
c *= 10; // c = c * 10;
c /= 2; // c = c / 2;
```

* incrementing and decrementing by 1

```C
// prefix: produces the new value of i
// ++i;
// --i;
int i = 1;
printf("%d", ++i); // prints 2

// postfix: produces the old value of i
// i++;
// i--;
int j = 1;
printf("%d", j++); // prints 1
printf("%d", j); // prints 2
```

>Postfix operation implies you must remember the old value. So, if you don't care about value produced, prefer to use prefix

## Intermediate Mutation (Racket)

What if we want to work with multiple address books?

```scheme
(define work '(("manager" 12345)
               ("director" 123456)))
```

Solution:

```scheme
(define home '())

(define (add-entry abook aname anumber)
  (set! abbok (cons (list aname anumber) abook)))

(add-entry home "Neighbour" 34567)

> home
> '() ; No Change!
```

* Code doesn't work
* Not immediately clear how to make it work
* substitution model does not explain the behavior
* Effectively, we are doing `(set! '() (cons (list "Neighbour" 34567) '()))`
* We can not change the meaning of an empty list
* To make this work, we need to use Lambda
* Do the same thing to creat a struct with one field called a box:
  * Two operations:
    * get the value in the box
    * set the value in the box

```scheme
(define (make-box v)
  (lambda (msg)
    (cond [(equal? msg 'get) v])))

(define (get b) (b 'get))

(define b1 (make-box 7))

> (get b1)
> 7
```
